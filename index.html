      <h2>Introduction to Huawei’s Digital Presence</h2>
      <p>
        In the modern digital business environment, company websites play a vital role in
        supporting online communication, marketing, and global customer engagement. Huawei,
        as a leading global technology company, uses its official website as a strategic
        digital platform to showcase its products, services, innovations, and corporate
        information. The website functions not only as an informational platform but also as
        an essential component of Huawei’s digital business strategy.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Huawei website supports digital marketing, customer relationship management,
        and brand positioning in the competitive technology industry. Through its structured
        interface and global accessibility, the website enables users, partners, and
        stakeholders to interact with the brand effectively. Therefore, analysing Huawei’s
        website is important to understand how large organisations utilise digital platforms
        to enhance customer experience and maintain competitive advantage.

  <!-- E-BUSINESS MODEL -->
  <section id="ebusiness" class="blog-section">
    <div class="blog-container">
      <h2>E-Business Model and Website Evaluation</h2>
      <p>
        Huawei’s website follows a hybrid e-business model that supports both Business-to-Business
        (B2B) and Business-to-Consumer (B2C) operations. The platform provides information about
        consumer products such as smartphones and smart devices, while also presenting enterprise
        solutions including cloud computing, networking, and digital infrastructure services.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the major strengths of the website is its professional design, structured navigation,
        and global accessibility. The interface is user-friendly and allows visitors to easily
        explore product categories, corporate information, and technological innovations. However,
        the website has limited direct e-commerce functionality compared to fully transactional
        platforms, which may reduce immediate purchasing engagement.
